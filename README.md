Java8 Features examples with java docs and some unit tests

#### Java Stream features
- Stream does not store elements. It simply conveys elements from a source such as a data structure, an array, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.
- Stream is functional in nature. Operations performed on a stream does not modify its source
- Stream is lazy and evaluates code only when required.
- The elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of a stream
